# Solace Topic Publish + Subscribe Sandbox

## Overview

When learning about core concepts of Solace Event Brokers, it is helpful to generate simple messages in a "hello world" fashion to publish them, and subsequently subscribe to the same. 

This web-based tool provides a ready-to-use sandbox environment, with the aim of guiding a user through the steps of:
1. Connecting to a Solace Event Broker
2. Registering a topic subscription to represent their interest
3. Constructing a suitable topic string and message payload
4. Sending the very first message
5. Receiving the same messages back again  

## Getting started quickly
